# Description

For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, my_ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, my_ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

The following options are available:

-a Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
-t Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

# Task

Your code must be compiled with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.

Watch out for memory leaks !
You can test your code against memory errors by compiling with the debugging flags -g3 -fsanitize=address
Global variables are strictly FORBIDDEN
tv_sec AND tv_nsec are used for the -t options ;-)
st_mtime is not what you want to use. You want to use st_mtim

you must create a Makefile, and the ouput is the command itself
You can use:
malloc(3)
free(3)
printf(3)
write(2)
stat(2)
lstat(2)
opendir(2)
closedir(2)
readdir(2)
You can NOT use:
Any functions / syscalls which does not appear in the previous list
Yes, it includes exit
Multiline macros are forbidden
Include another .c is forbidden
Macros with logic (while/if/variables/...) are forbidden
